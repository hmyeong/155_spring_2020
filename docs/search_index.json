["software-setup.html", "Software Setup Troubleshooting", " Software Setup Before class on Monday, January 27, you should follow these instructions to set up the software that we’ll be using throughout the semester. Highly recommended: Change the default file download location for your internet browser Generally by default, internet browsers automatically save all files to the Downloads folder on your computer. This does not encourage good file organization practices. It is highly recommended that you change this option so that your browser asks you where to save each file before downloading it. This page has information on how to do this for the most common browsers. Required: Download R and RStudio FIRST: Download R here. You will see three links “Download R for …” Choose the link that corresponds to your computer. SECOND: Download RStudio here. Click the button under step 2 to install the version of RStudio recommended for your computer. Required: Please watch this video made by Professor Lisa Lendway that describes essential configuration options for RStudio. Required: Install required packages. An R package is an extra bit of functionality that will help us in our data analysis efforts in a variety of ways. Open RStudio and click inside the Console pane (by default, the bottom left pane). Copy and paste the following command into the Console. You should see the text below appear to the right of the &gt;, which is called the R prompt. After you paste, hit Enter. install.packages(c(&quot;ggplot2&quot;, &quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;readr&quot;, &quot;rmarkdown&quot;)) You will see a lot of text from status messages appearing in the Console as the packages are being installed. Wait until you see the &gt; again. Enter the command library(ggplot2) and hit enter. If you see the message Error in library(ggplot2) : there is no package called ggplot2, then there was a problem installing this package. Jump down to the Troubleshooting section below. (Any other messages that appear are fine, and a lack of any messages is also fine.) Repeat the above step for the commands: library(dplyr) library(readr) library(rmarkdown) Quit RStudio. You’re done setting up! Optional: If you want a quick tour of RStudio before class on Monday, watch this video. It also shows you how to customize the layout and color scheme of RStudio. Troubleshooting Problem: You are on a Mac and getting the following error: Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘ggplot2’ in loadNamespace(i, c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[i]]): there is no package called ‘rlang’ Here’s how to fix it: First install the suite of Command Line Tools for Mac using the instructions here. Next enter install.packages(&quot;rlang&quot;) in the Console. Finally check that entering library(ggplot2) gives no errors. You should be good now for dplyr, readr, and rmarkdown. "],

Share your names, preferred pronouns, and anything else that is important to you. A taste of data visualization in R Throughout the semester we’ll be using the statistical software R to analyze data. We’ll take a first look at R code today in the following activity. Board games are a favorite hobby of your instructor, and to her delight, there is a dataset containing information about many different board games and their ratings from the website BoardGameGeek.com! You will work through exploring this dataset in pairs, and the instructor will be circling around to help. For some phases of this exploration, you will need to have this page open to access the data description. This code may seem foreign at first, but over the semester you will have a lot of practice, and you’ll be able to write code like this by yourself at the end! Today, focus on getting a feel for what the code looks like and its potential for helping us gain insight. Warm-up The data are stored in an object (a container) called games. Let’s get a quick feel for this data. How many variables are present? Which are quantitative? Which are categorical? How many cases, or units of observation, do we have? How are the variables named / labeled? eyJsYW5ndWFnZSI6InIiLCJwcmVfZXhlcmNpc2VfY29kZSI6ImxpYnJhcnkoZ2dwbG90MilcbmxpYnJhcnkoZHBseXIpXG5saWJyYXJ5KHJlYWRyKVxuZ2FtZXMgPC0gcmVhZHI6OnJlYWRfY3N2KFwiaHR0cHM6Ly9yYXcuZ2l0aHVidXNlcmNvbnRlbnQuY29tL3Jmb3JkYXRhc2NpZW5jZS90aWR5dHVlc2RheS9tYXN0ZXIvZGF0YS8yMDE5LzIwMTktMDMtMTIvYm9hcmRfZ2FtZXMuY3N2XCIpIiwic2FtcGxlIjoiIyBMb29rIGF0IHRoZSBmaXJzdCA2IHJvd3NcbmhlYWQoZ2FtZXMpXG5cbiMgSG93IG1hbnkgcm93cyBhbmQgY29sdW1ucyBkb2VzIHRoZSBkYXRhIGhhdmU/XG4jIFdoYXQgYXJlIGl0cyBkaW1lbnNpb25zP1xuZGltKGdhbWVzKSJ9 Phase 1 Use the code below to construct a visualization (a histogram) of average ratings for the games.

Shape: How are values distributed along the observed range? What does the distribution of the variable look like? games &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-03-12/board_games.csv&quot;) ggplot(games, aes(x = min_playtime)) + geom_density() Center: What is a typical value of the variable?

Max. ## 0.00 25.00 45.00 80.88 90.00 60000.00 Spread: How spread out are the values? Are most values very close together or far apart? Quantified with summary statistics like the variance and standard deviation. Interpretation of the variance: it is the average (roughly) squared distance of each value to the mean. Units are the squared version of the original variable. Interpretation of the standard deviation: square root of the variance. Measures spread on the same scale as the original variable (same units as the original variable). var(games$min_playtime) ## [1] 406883.1 sd(games$min_playtime) ## [1] 637.8739 Outliers: Are there any values that are particularly high or low relative to the rest? A good paragraph putting all of these aspects together: The distribution of minimum playtimes is right-skewed with values ranging from 0 to 60,000 minutes. The center of the distribution is around 45 minutes (median). The mean is higher at about 80.88 minutes because of the high outliers (such as the game with a 60,000 minute minimum play time). Because of the outliers, it is difficult to see the spread of the bulk of the data clearly, and it is these outliers that contribute to the high standard deviation of 637.9 minutes. Qualities of a good paragraph: Describes the shape and range of the data Includes units Reports on the mean and median and explains any discrepancies between them Describes spread in terms of standard deviation Comments on the noteworthy visual features of the plot, including outliers Exercises A template RMarkdown document that you can start from is available here. As you proceed, put any new code that you encounter on your cheat sheet. Part 1 We have data on course evaluations for all courses offered in the Spring 2019 semester at Johns Hopkins University (source). We have the following pieces of information on each course: avg_rating: The average of student responses to the question asking them to rate the overall quality of the course using the Likert scale: 1 = Poor 2 = Weak 3 = Fair 4 = Good 5 = Excellent division: Either AS for Arts &amp; Sciences or EN for Engineering dept_name: Name of the department # Load required packages library(readr) library(ggplot2) # Read in the course evaluation data evals &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/3gayi1iq2p76kn0/jhu_evals.csv?dl=1&quot;) Exercise 1 The first step in any data analysis is to get acquainted with the data. Look at the first few rows, and obtain the dimensions of the dataset. # Look at the first 6 rows head(evals) # Get the dimensions of the dataset dim(evals) How many cases are there? (What are the cases?) What type of variable are the key ones described above? Exercise 2 Are the numbers of courses taught in the Arts &amp; Sciences and the Engineering divisions roughly the same? Before making the plot, make note of what your expectation is. Then compare to what you observe when you make the plot. (Clearly defining your expectations first is good scientific practice that is often not practiced enough to become habit.) ggplot(evals, aes(x = division)) + geom_bar() Exercise 3 Now we’ll look at the distribution of the avg_rating variable and associated summary statistics. Just like before, make note of what you expect the plots to look like before you make them. # Plots ggplot(evals, aes(x = avg_rating)) + geom_histogram() ggplot(evals, aes(x = avg_rating)) + geom_density() # Summary statistics # Adapt the code from the Discussion section to compute these ??? Write a good paragraph interpreting the histogram or density plot. (Discuss the 4 essential aspects.) What information is given by the tallest bar of the histogram? In what situations might you prefer a histogram to a density plot and vice-versa? Looking at the summary statistics, compare the mean to the median, and relate this to the shape of the distribution of average ratings. What would the distribution probably look like if the ordering of the mean and median were reversed? Part 2 When we are sitting behind a computer screen analyzing data, it can be easy to get caught up in the code, methods, or findings, and lose track of the human impact of our analysis. The analysis we did in Part 1 actually foreshadows a rather serious ethical concern for faculty. Exercise 4 Suppose that you were asked to rate the overall quality of one of your Fall courses on a 5-point scale. What kinds of things would you think about in giving your rating? Do you think you would give the same rating on a different day? In your opinion, do you think other students are using the same criteria as you? Exercise 5 In this last exercise, we’ll explore the misleading nature of the mean of Likert-scale responses. The datasets being read in below come from 3 different courses with 20 students each. For each student we have their rating of the overall course quality on the scale: 1 = Poor 2 = Weak 3 = Fair 4 = Good 5 = Excellent # Read in the course evaluation data course1 &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/qbw4ahys9mkxsqj/course1.csv?dl=1&quot;) course2 &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/tg8g0hchh435lx7/course2.csv?dl=1&quot;) course3 &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/b3cg2tdbpyjzwr6/course3.csv?dl=1&quot;) For each course, make an appropriate plot showing the distribution of student ratings. Put yourself in the professor’s shoes and briefly summarize the information that the plot gives. # Plot the distribution of ratings for each course ??? Now compute the mean rating for each course. You can adapt the code from the Discussion section to replace summary with mean to display only the mean. # Compute the mean rating for each course ??? Consider a school policy that ranks professors based on this mean rating and uses the rankings for evaluative and promotion purposes. Based on your investigations so far, would such a policy be fair? Is there a potential for it creating injustice? Extra! If you have time and want to explore more, try these exercises. Make a plot showing the number of courses by department. Is it effective? Add the following to the end of the code for your last plot. What does this code do? Add this to your cheat sheet. + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) Continue adding to the same plot the following code. What does it do?

As you proceed, put any new code that you encounter on your cheat sheet. Context and Setup Today we begin our data exploration for our first case study! We’ll be looking at a dataset of weightlifting competition results to understand how various factors relate to an athlete’s strength. The data originally come from Kaggle and OpenPowerlifting. # Load required packages library(readr) library(ggplot2) library(dplyr) # Read in the course evaluation data lifts &lt;- read_csv(&quot;https://www.dropbox.com/s/n6jko5m7ygeasoj/openpowerlifting_subs.csv?dl=1&quot;) Exercise 1 As always, we’ll start by getting acquainted with the data. Look at the first few rows, and obtain the dimensions of the dataset. # Look at the first 6 rows # Get the dimensions of the dataset How many cases are there? (What are the cases?) What kinds of variables do we have information on? (Are there broader categories of variables?) Look up any variables that are unfamiliar (for example, Wilks Coefficient). Exercise 2 Research question: Do males and females tend to use different types of equipment? The three barplots below give different ways of showing the Sex and Equipment variables. Which one is best suited to answering this research question and why? ggplot(lifts, aes(x = Sex, fill = Equipment)) + geom_bar() ggplot(lifts, aes(x = Sex, fill = Equipment)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;dodge&quot;) ggplot(lifts, aes(x = Sex, fill = Equipment)) + geom_bar(position = &quot;fill&quot;) Exercise 3 Your client for this case study (Leslie) is interested in using two of the variables to compute a third one. In particular, she wants to create a variable that is the ratio of total weight lifted to the athlete’s bodyweight. The code below creates a new variable called SWR (strength-to-weight ratio). Read through the code below and get a sense for what it is doing. If you have questions, ask the instructor. # The %&gt;% symbol is called a pipe. You can read it as: # take the output that comes before the pipe and feed it in as input to the function that comes after lifts &lt;- lifts %&gt;% mutate(SWR = TotalKg/BodyweightKg) Research question: How does strength-to-weight ratio differ between males and females? The code below makes different plots that can be used to explore this question. Before running the code, make note of what you expect. How might each contribute to answering the research question? Which one(s) would you choose to present to your client and why? ggplot(lifts, aes(x = SWR, fill = Sex)) + geom_histogram() ggplot(lifts, aes(x = SWR, fill = Sex)) + geom_histogram() + facet_grid(~ Sex) ggplot(lifts, aes(x = SWR, color = Sex)) + geom_density() ggplot(lifts, aes(x = Sex, y = SWR)) + geom_boxplot() Exercise 4 Did you notice anything unusual about the shape of the distribution of SWR in males and females? What group of athletes do you think is causing this peculiar shape? (Hint: you may have noticed this when you looked at the first few rows of the data.) Let’s filter out these individuals and remake your preferred plots from Exercise 3. Do you think that the rest of the analysis should proceed with these athletes filtered out? # Fill in the ??? below with a description of the athletes that you want to KEEP # See Day 1 - Phase 5 for an example lifts_subs &lt;- lifts %&gt;% filter(???) # Now remake your preferred plots from Exercise 3 Extra!
