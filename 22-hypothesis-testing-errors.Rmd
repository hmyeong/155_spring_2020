# Hypothesis Testing Errors

## Learning Goals {-}

- Explain the trade-offs between type 1 and type 2 errors
- Explain how different factors affect the power of a hypothesis test
- Connect concepts of error rates to practical ethical considerations in the conduct of science

<br><br><br><br>

## Exercises {-}

### Exercise 1 {-}

Navigate to [this page](https://rpsychologist.com/d3/nhst/) to perform an interactive investigation on what factors influence statistical power.

Under "Settings", choose the button that solves for power. You will vary the different parameters (one at a time) to understand how these factors affect power.

Some context behind this interactive visualization:

- Visualization is based on a one sample Z-test:    
    This is a test for whether the true population mean equals a particular value. (e.g., true mean = 30)
- The effect size slider is measured with a metric called Cohen's d:
    - Cohen's d = magnitude of effect/standard deviation of response variable
    - Here: how far is the true mean from the null value in units of SD?
    - e.g., If the null value is 30, true mean is 40, and the true population SD of the quantity is 5, the Cohenâ€™s d effect size is (40-30)/5 = 2.

a. What is your intuition about how changing the significance level will change power? Check your intuition with the visualization and explain why this happens.

b. Repeat part (a) for sample size.

c. Repeat part (a) for the effect size. As you reason through this, think first about the impact of the numerator of Cohen's d (magnitude of the effect). Second, think about the impact of the denominator of Cohen's d (SD of the response variable).

### Exercise 2 {-}

For each of the situations below, describe what a type I error and a type II error mean in context. Which is worse?

- $H_0$: defendant is innocent    
    $H_A$: defendant is guilty
- $H_0$: males and females benefit equally from a drug    
    $H_A$: males and females do not benefit equally from a drug

For the second situation, write down a potential linear regression model formula and a logistic regression model formula that could investigate these hypotheses. (You'll need to add a little more contextual information on your own.)

### Exercise 3 {-}

Visit [this page](https://mchankins.wordpress.com/2013/04/21/still-not-significant-2/) and look at both the comic at the top and the various ways in which researchers have described p-values that do not fall below the $\alpha = 0.05$ significance level threshold.

What ethical consideration is arising here? What are your views on this? (Keep these thoughts in mind as you work on Case Study 2.)

Just for fun: a related [xkcd comic](https://xkcd.com/1478/)

### Exercise 4 {-}

Suppose that a hypothesis test yields a p-value of $1\times 10^{-6}$. Often times, when a p-value falls below the significance level threshold, this is called a **statistically significant** result.

What can you tell about the magnitude of the effect or the uncertainty of the effect from this p-value? (i.e., What can you tell about the coefficient estimate or the standard error?)

The notion here is a differentiation between statistical and *practical* significance. What do you think this idea is referring to?

### Exercise 5 {-}

Take a look at the xkcd comic [here](https://xkcd.com/882/). What do you think is going on here? Explain in terms of class concepts.
